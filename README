PieDock
=======

PieDock is a task bar and application launcher in shape of a pie menu.
It feels a little bit like the famous OS X dock in a circle.

Watch this [video](http://vimeo.com/21360384) to see it in action.

Requirements
------------

Requires a C++ compiler, headers and libraries of X11 and libpng.
Xft and the X Rendering Extension (to make use of a compositing manager)
are optional.

Runs on Linux, BSD and Solaris.

Installation
------------

Manual configure, compile and install:

	$ ./configure

Alternatively, for Gnome integration, run configure with:

	$ ./configure --enable-gtk

Or for KDE use:

	$ ./configure --enable-kde

To compile:

	$ make

Then as root:

	# make install-strip

Finally, you may want to invoke the setup script with normal privileges:

	$ sh/setup

Or manually copy res/piedockrc.sample to ~/.piedockrc and modify it to
meet your needs.
